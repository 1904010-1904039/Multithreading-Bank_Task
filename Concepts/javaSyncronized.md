The `synchronized` keyword in Java is used to control access to a critical section of code or an object in order to prevent race conditions and ensure thread safety. It can be applied to methods or blocks of code to restrict access so that only one thread can execute the synchronized code at a time. 

### Synchronized Methods

When a method is declared with the `synchronized` keyword, the method locks the object it belongs to. If the method is static, it locks the class object itself.

#### Example of a Synchronized Method

```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    // Synchronized instance method
    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    // Synchronized instance method
    public synchronized int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Counter counter = new Counter();

        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        // join() is required, otherwise the main thread might finish its execution and print the value of count. Inconsistent output
        t1.join();
        t2.join();

        // This line is executed by the main thread
        System.out.println("Count: " + counter.getCount());
    }
}
```

In this example:
- The `increment` and `getCount` methods are synchronized, meaning that only one thread can execute **either of these methods** at a time for a particular instance of `Counter`.
- The two threads `t1` and `t2` both increment the counter 1000 times, but because the methods are synchronized, the final count is correctly computed as `2000`.

### Synchronized Blocks

A synchronized block is used to synchronize a specific block of code instead of the entire method. This provides more fine-grained control over synchronization, potentially improving performance by reducing the scope of the lock.

#### Example of a Synchronized Block

```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    // shared Monitor object `lock`
    private final Object lock = new Object(); 

    public void increment() {
        synchronized (lock) {
            count++;
        }
    }

    public int getCount() {
        synchronized (lock) {
            return count;
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Counter counter = new Counter();

        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        t1.join();
        t2.join();

        System.out.println("Count: " + counter.getCount());
    }
}
```

In this example:
- The `increment` and `getCount` methods use synchronized blocks to synchronize on the `lock` object.
- This approach allows you to synchronize only the critical section of code, potentially improving performance.

### Differences Between Synchronized Methods and Synchronized Blocks

1. **Scope of Synchronization**:
   - **Synchronized Method**: The entire method is locked.
   - **Synchronized Block**: Only the specified block of code is locked.

2. **Flexibility**:
   - **Synchronized Method**: Less flexible because it locks the entire method.
   - **Synchronized Block**: More flexible because it allows fine-grained control over which code sections need to be synchronized.

3. **Lock Object**:
   - **Synchronized Method**: Locks the instance of the object (or the class for static methods).
   - **Synchronized Block**: Can lock on any object, providing more control over synchronization.

### Using `synchronized` with Static Methods

Static methods can also be synchronized, in which case the lock is on the `Class` object rather than an instance of the class.

#### Example of a Synchronized Static Method

```java
class Counter {
    private static int count = 0;

    public static synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public static synchronized int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                Counter.increment();
            }
        });

        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                Counter.increment();
            }
        });

        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        t1.join();
        t2.join();

        System.out.println("Count: " + Counter.getCount());
    }
}
```

In this example:
- The `increment` and `getCount` methods are static and synchronized, meaning they lock on the `Counter` class object.

### Advantages of Synchronized Methods and Blocks

1. **Thread Safety**: Ensures that only one thread at a time can execute the synchronized code, preventing race conditions.
2. **Atomic Operations**: Makes a block of code atomic and isolated from other threads.

### Disadvantages of Synchronized Methods and Blocks

1. **Performance Overhead**: Synchronization can lead to performance overhead due to the locking mechanism.
2. **Potential Deadlocks**: Improper use of synchronization can lead to deadlocks, where two or more threads are waiting indefinitely for each other to release locks.

### Conclusion

The `synchronized` keyword in Java provides a simple and effective way to ensure thread safety in concurrent applications. By using synchronized methods and blocks, you can control access to critical sections of your code, ensuring that shared resources are accessed in a safe and consistent manner.
